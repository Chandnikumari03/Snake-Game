# Snake-Game
This is a classic Snake Game built using Python and Pygame. The player controls a yellow snake on abackground, guiding it to eat randomly spawning food. Each time the snake eats, it grows in length, making it harder to avoid collisions with the walls or itself. The game ends when the snake hits a boundary or its body.
